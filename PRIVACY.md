# PRIVACY.md — Privacy Policy & Data Minimization Notice
### VanishText {Made by SUVX}

At **VanishText**, privacy is an absolute structural commitment, not merely a policy statement. Our software is deliberately engineered from the ground up to prevent data collection, persistent tracking, and conversation storage.

## 1. Principles of Data Minimization

- **No User Accounts**: You do not register, create passwords, provide email addresses, verify phone numbers, or connect social profiles.
- **Temporary Nicknames Only**: Nicknames are ephemeral strings chosen for the duration of a single conversation and are never indexed or saved.
- **Strictly One-to-One**: No public directories, room searches, or group chats exist.
- **Text-Only**: Image uploads, video chats, voice recordings, and file attachments are completely blocked.

## 2. Zero Chat History & Ephemeral Lifecycle Rules

- **Automatic Message Deletion (15-Minute Lifespan)**: Every message automatically disappears from both users' chat screens exactly 15 minutes after it was sent. Each message operates on its own independent 15-minute timer based on verified creation time.
- **Immediate Wiping on Leave Room**: When either user leaves the room, all displayed chat messages are cleared immediately for that user. Refreshing the page or rejoining does not and cannot restore previous messages.
- **1-Hour Room Expiration (Real Elapsed Time)**: Each room expires exactly 1 hour after creation, measured in real elapsed time. When 1 hour elapses, both users are disconnected, the chat interface is cleared, the invitation code is invalidated, and the expired room is permanently disabled.
- **No Room Reactivation**: An expired room can never be reactivated or re-entered. The creator must create a completely new room with a new invitation code.
- **No Persistent Chat History**: Chat messages are never saved to `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `IndexedDB`, databases, persistent queues, or chat logs. VanishText maintains zero persistent records of conversation contents.
- **Reliable Enforcement**: Message expiration and room expiration are enforced using real elapsed time checks, network-synchronized time authorities, and monotonic clock verification to prevent timer drift, tab-sleep suspension, or local clock manipulation from bypassing expiration.

## 3. End-to-End Encryption Disclosures

- All messages are encrypted directly inside your browser using **AES-256-GCM** with keys established via ephemeral **ECDH P-256** and **HKDF SHA-256**.
- The signaling provider (PeerJS Cloud broker / WebRTC STUN) only coordinates the initial connection handshake. It receives **only ciphertext** and **never possesses your private encryption keys** or message plaintext.

## 4. Honest Privacy Guarantees & Technical Limitations

We do not make dishonest marketing claims that "every trace is permanently erased from all systems worldwide". True privacy engineering requires honest disclosure of technical realities:

1. **Unavoidable Infrastructure Metadata**: To negotiate direct WebRTC peer connections, standard Internet protocols require routing metadata:
   - **IP Addresses & Port Numbers**: Processed by public STUN servers (e.g. Google STUN) to establish Direct P2P NAT traversal.
   - **Connection Timestamps & Signaling Payloads**: Ephemeral rendezvous packets routed through the PeerJS cloud broker during the initial handshake.
   - **Provider-Side Retention**: Third-party infrastructure providers (STUN operators, signaling relays, ISPs) maintain their own operational logs that may record connection IPs and access timestamps according to their respective logging policies.
2. **Operating-System & Hardware Realities**:
   - While VanishText zeroizes memory buffers and destroys JavaScript variables, operating system memory management (such as OS swap/paging files, volatile RAM until overwritten, and browser process memory) is governed by the host operating system.
3. **Physical & Screen Capture Limits**:
   - While VanishText provides a Privacy Shield blur overlay upon window unfocus and blocks standard inspection shortcuts, no web application can prevent hardware capture cards, OS-level screen recording tools (OBS, Snipping Tool, ShadowPlay), external cameras, or a conversation partner manually photographing their display.
   - Choose your conversation partners wisely.
